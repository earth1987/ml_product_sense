    "  \n",
    "*How it works:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The null hypothesis is assumed to be true\n",
    "2) The sampling distribution of the test statistic is computed using a permutation test or standard reference distribution. This indicates the random variability in the test statistic\n",
    "4) A p-value is calculated for the test statistic using the sampling distribution\n",
    "5) A significance test is conducted. The p-value is compared to a significance threshold. If it is below the threshold, the null hypothesis is rejected (and vice versa).\n",
    "   * For a single-tailed test, compare the p-value to the *alpha* significance level\n",
    "   * For a two-tailed test, compare the p-value to half the *alpha* significance level \n",
    "\n",
    "*Definitions:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* The p-value represents the probability, given a chance model that embodies the null hypothesis, of a result *at least* as extreme as the observed effect. It therefore indicates whether the observed effect is a reasonable outcome of a \"null\" model.\n",
    "* *Alpha* is the probability threshold that chance results must surpass for actual outcomes to be deemed statistically significant. It represents the acceptable probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*p-value controversy:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* A p-value does NOT give the probability the alternate hypothesis is true.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Used to estimate the sampling distribution when the null hypothesis is true\n",

    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "1) No assumptions are made about the shape of the distribution (e.g. normal etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*How it works:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Combine A & B groups and shuffle subjects\n",
    "2) Use sampling without replacement to recreate each of the groups (with their original size)\n",
    "3) Recalculate the test statistic (e.g. mean values for A and B) and the difference in magnitude between the groups (e.g. mean B - mean A)\n",
    "4) Repeat the above steps multiple times (e.g. 1000 for 0.001 precision in p-value) to yield a distribution for the *difference* in the test statistic (i.e. effect size)\n",
    "5) Use this sampling distribution to estimate a p-value for the observed difference between A & B\n",

    "\n",

    "* z-score (AKA z-statistic)\n",
    "* t-score (AKA t-statistic)\n",
    "* chi-squared statistic\n",
    "  \n",
    "3) Calculate the p-value that corresponds to the standardised statistic\n",
    "4) Conduct a significance test. Compare the p-value to a pre-selected *alpha* significance level. If it is below the significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected (and vice versa).\n",

    "* Two-tailed tests are used when the alternative hypothesis is not directional (e.g. A is different to B). Compare the p-value to half the *alpha* significance level \n",
    "Note: Often two-tailed tests are used with directional hypotheses as they are more conservative and protect you from being fooled by chance in both directions\n",
